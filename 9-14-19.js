// Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

// For example:

// Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
// Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
// You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

//   It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?

// Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.

// If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.

// Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed with "£" (= "\u00A3", JS and Java) or "$" (C#, C++, Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, PHP and Python, Haskell).

//   Write a function called repeatString which repeats the given String src exactly count times.

//   Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in.

// Example:

// reverseWords("The greatest victory is that which requires no battle")
// // should return "battle no requires which that is victory greatest The"

    return str.split(' ').reverse().join(' '); // reverse those words
  }

//   Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

// Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.

// Examples
// maskify("4556364607935616") == "############5616"
// maskify(     "64607935616") ==      "#######5616"
// maskify(               "1") ==                "1"
// maskify(                "") ==                 ""

// // "What was the name of your first pet?"
// maskify("Skippy")                                   == "##ippy"
// maskify("Nananananananananananananananana Batman!") == "####################################man!"

    return cc.length < 4 ? cc : '#'.repeat(cc.length - 4) + cc.substring(cc.length - 4)
