// Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

// Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

// Examples:

// Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
// Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
// Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
// Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
// Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
// Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
// Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
// Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11
// However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.

//   A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.

// He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

// His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.

// How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?

// Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:
// Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
// Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
// Float parameter "window" must be less than h.
// If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.

// Note:
// The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater than the window parameter.

// Example:
// - h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3

// - h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1 

// (Condition 2) not fulfilled).
