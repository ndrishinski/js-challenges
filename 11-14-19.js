// Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

// For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks.

// If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer.

function breakChocolate(n,m) {
    return n * m -1 < 0 ? 0 : n * m -1;
  }

//   Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first (n) multiples of (x).

// Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

// Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).

// Examples:

// countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
// countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]


function countBy(x, n) {
    var z = [x];
    var lx = x
    while (z.length < n) {
      lx += x
      z.push(lx)
    }
    return z;
  }

//   After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

// You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

// Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

// Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

    return d >= 7 ? tot - 50 : d >= 3 && d < 7 ? tot - 20 : tot
